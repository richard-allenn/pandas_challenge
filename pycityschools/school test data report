this report covers a sample of students test scores from 15 different schools and a total of 39 thousand students.

the aim of this report is to find correlations between student test scores and school type, size and budget.

by building data frames grouping by school and cost per student the following conclusions were drawn.

percentage of students passing overall in independant schools is 6 % higher than in public schools

per student budget has no strong linear correlation to student success.

when looking at the 5 top performing and 5 lowest performing schools by % overall passing. there tends to be a correlation between number of students and schools performance. 
the top 5 schools average 2820 students compared to:
the lowest 5 schools 3467 students average.

from schools below 1000 students to schools with 1000 - 2000 students there is only a 1 % drop in overall scores and passing. 
however for schools above 2000 students % overall passing drops 8% but the average maths and reading scores drop 1-2%. 
this displays the possibility that in a very large school struggling students recieves less support and fall father behind the cohort than they would have in a smaller school.
